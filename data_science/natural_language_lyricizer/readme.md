## How To Use

For this app to work clone this repo onto your computer. Make sure to install the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file along with it.

You'll first need to train your own model. Either you run the code from `lyricizer.ipynb` script as is or after you made the desired changes to let the model recognize bands that you'll like. After that, you can simply run the `cli_lyricizer.py` file.
